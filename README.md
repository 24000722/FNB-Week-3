# 🌿 Pine City Zoo App – Week 3 Project (FNB App Academy)

Welcome to Week 3 of my FNB App Academy journey! This week, I built a multi-page fictional zoo app called **Pine City Zoo**, applying everything I've learned so far in HTML and CSS—plus a deeper focus on layout, styling, and navigation.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Pine City Zoo app serves as a digital tour guide for visitors. It showcases zoo features like animal bios, places to visit, the weather forecast, and even a feedback form. This project pushed me to think like a developer — planning ahead, organizing code properly, and designing for real users.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced

- Project folder organization (images, HTML, CSS)
- Responsive layout using `<div>` containers and fixed navigation
- Creating reusable styles using an external `style.css` file
- Building consistent navigation menus (top and bottom tabs)
- Floating elements using `float` and aligning with `margin`, `padding`
- CSS backgrounds, hover effects, and positioning
- Linking pages together for a seamless multi-page user experience
- Designing and styling:
  - **Animal bios pages** (with summaries and full descriptions)
  - **Places pages** (like amphitheatre and garden)
  - **Weather page** (with temperature icons and forecast table)
  - **Feedback page** (with a user input form)
